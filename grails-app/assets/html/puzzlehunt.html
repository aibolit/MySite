        I built this website after we ran Bloomberg's first puzzlehunt and realized we had a logistics issue. The people giving out
        the puzzle materials needed a quick way to see who had access to which puzzles and the thirty people in needed an
        efficient way to be assigned hint requests and communicates with the teams. I built this site with logins for players,
        admins, hinters and the copy room, with the ability for eveyone to communicate.
        <br/> One of the coolest properties is that all of the puzzles, players, rewards and even style of the website are defined
        by a single json config file. Nothing is hard-coded; it's all ready for next year.
