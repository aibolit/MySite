        I built this website after we ran Bloomberg's first Mystery Hunt and realized we had a logistics issue. The people giving
        out the puzzle materials needed a quick way to see who had access to which puzzles and the thirty people in needed
        an efficient way to be assigned hint requests and communicates with the teams.
        <br/> I built this website to manage eveything about the Mystery Hunt. It has logins for players, admins, hinters and
        the copy room, with the ability for eveyone to communicate.
        <ul style="margin: 0 0 0 0">
            <li> Players can view their puzzles and rewards, submit answers and ask for hints.</li>
            <li> Hinters get assigned requests based on many factors including puzzle difficulty, how long the request has been
                open, and whether they have helped the team before.</li>
            <li> The copy room can tell which puzzles they can give out to whom.</li>
            <li> Finally Admins can change anything about the hunt in real time.</li>
        </ul>
        One of the coolest properties is that all of the puzzles, players, rewards and even style of the website are defined by a
        single json config file. Nothing is hard-coded; the site is all ready for next year.
