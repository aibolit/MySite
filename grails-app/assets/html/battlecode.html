                Yep, that's really
                <label style="color:orange">me</label> up there.
                <br/>This is where a lot of it started.
                <a href="https://www.battlecode.org/" target="_blank">Battlecode</a> is a month long AI programming competition at MIT. I made a player freshman year, but after
                that, I became a director. I got to design and build the game, the map editor, and a web viewer to display
                matches in the browser. More immportantly, it was the start of my passion of encouraging learning through
                playing games. I ran lectures organized, organized coding sessions, and worked with the teams to help develop
                their player.

                <a href="https://www.battlecode.org/" target="_blank">Battlecode</a> was very inspirational to me, so I couldn't just leave. When I started recruiting from MIT
                with Bloomberg, I made sure that
                <a href="https://www.battlecode.org/" target="_blank">Battlecode</a> got a sponsorship, and that we could show what Bloomberg was all about.
                <br/> In order to do this. I modified the engine to make a single-player version of the game with special objectives.
                One year, it was to fight off the zombies hordes (an overpowered AI), another year it was to navigate a complex
                maze.
