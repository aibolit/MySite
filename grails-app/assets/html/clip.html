        Using this extension, you can clip, annotate, tag, and share any web page within the Bloomberg Terminal without actually
        bringing up the Terminal.
        <br/>Logging into the Bloomberg terminal requires going through four factor authentication. This requires quite a bit
        of time and effort which you might not want to go through if you want to take a simple note. If you're an analyst
        writing a research article, taking notes on the web comes up often.
        <br/> This problem was impacting some of the projects I was working on, so I decided pitch the extension to my manager
        and implement it. A few month's later I had Bloomberg's first in-house built chrome extension on the web store.
