        When Bloomberg started sponsoring the MIT Media Lab, the powers at be picked out the
        <a href="http://fluid.media.mit.edu/projects/perifoveal-display" target="_blank">Perifoveal Display</a> as a project to pursue. This made perfect sense considering we have clients with twenty plus
        monitors in a pod all around them. The idea of the
        <a href="http://fluid.media.mit.edu/projects/perifoveal-display" target="_blank">Perifoveal Display</a>
        is to detect where the user is looking and alert them to where important events are occuring.
        <br/> I was asked to implement the project for Bloomberg, so I made my own version from scratch based on the video of
        the original. In my version, the face tracking is done as a service, and the UI can connect to the service be run
        off of multiple computers.
