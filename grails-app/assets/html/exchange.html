        My manager came to me. "Can you help me with recruiting", he said. "When I go to recruit from Virginia Tech, all the students
        come to us looking for banking jobs. Can you run one of those 'Battlecode' events to show the students we are a Tech
        and Media company?".
        <br/>Two months later I had a game that was quite different. On the surface it looked like a stock exchange. The difference
        was that the only market changing actions could be taken by the players connected to it. There were a few other wacky
        rules, like earning exponentially decreasing dividends every second on what your player owned (to keep the trades
        moving at a faster pace).
        <br/>The only way to play was to connect to an api we provided. We ran it at Virginia tech, and created a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD1ETVxklSA" target="_blank">video</a>. One of the students even
        <a href="http://gildedguy.com/1st-at-bloombergvt-hackathon/" target="_blank">blogged</a> about it.
        <br/>Since then, we have have run the event in universities across five states and Canada as overnight hackcathons. It'a
        a very rewarding feeling teaching network programming with a team of students, and then three hours later talking
        AI and strategy.
