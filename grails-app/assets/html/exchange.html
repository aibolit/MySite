        My manager came to me. "Can you help me with recruiting", he said. "When I go to recruit from Virginia Tech, all the students
        come to us looking for banking jobs. Can you help do one of those Battlecode events to show the students we are a
        tech & media company?".
        <br/>Two months later I had a game that was quite different. On the surface it looked like a stock exchange. The difference
        was that the only market changing actions were by the players connected to it. There were a few other wacky rules
        like earning exponentially decreasing dividends every second on what your player owned. Oh and the only way to play
        was to connect to an api we provided.
        <br/>Since then, we have have run the event in universities across five states and Canada as overnight hackcathons. It'a
        a great rewarding feeling teaching network programming with a team of students, and then three hours later talking
        game strategy.
