        A couple of years ago, Bloomberg decided to run a Mystery Hunt for the interns. That year, I was asked to build a final boss
        puzzle as a video game. I decided to go with a classic; here is a shortened version.
        <br/>One of the cool things about this little game, is that it is a client server model. The server computes all the gameplay,
        and sends deltas to the client whereas the client sends keyboard input to the server. This was necessary so that
        the players couldn't fake winning the game to get the secret answer.
