        After having built the mock Stock Exhchange hackathon, and run the event many times, there was a need for something fresh.
        I was playing around with simulating physics at the time, so I got the idea to make a game that that was similar
        to Asteroids (the game from 1979).
        <br/> In this game each player controls a space ship in a torus-shaped world. The only way to move the ship is to set
        an instantaneous acceleration on it (hind of like a thruster). That makes controlling the velocity a bit tricky,
        especially since all the players conect to the server over the web. In order to win, the players need to visit pre-placed
        locations, and drop mines to keep the other players away.
        <br/> Oh, and in case anyone thought to create a keyboard player, the locations are many times smaller than a pixel. Only
        a finely tined AI would be able to play.
        <br/> Unlike the Exchange, this game was a lot more visual, so I also built a web UI that the players could connect to
        and view the game in a browser.
